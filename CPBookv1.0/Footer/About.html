<p>
Hello There!
I am <span id="ABOUT-BooleanCube"></span><strong id="BooleanCube">BooleanCube</strong>.
</p>

<p>
This is a book I am writing more like a template or a study book for competitive programming.
Something like a resource for people to use and learn, revise and last-second study as well right before a competition as well.
</p>

<p>
I am a student who is a bot dev, game dev, and also a competitive programmer as a hobby.
I am mainly fluent in Java, C#, Python, C++, and I am fairly fluent in Lua, HTML, CSS, and Node.JS
</p>

<p>
I have been to several competitive programming competitions before such as I have been to HSPT at UCF, Cornell, Stetson University. I have also attended a bunch of USACO competitions (currently hard-stuck bronze Sadge) and also a bunch of Game Jams and Hackathons. I am also probably working on one of my projects for bot-dev or game-dev right now. I stream it on twitch some weekends.
</p>

<p>
This book was written using the wiki syntax and a neovim plugin called vimwiki. It is a great tool for note-taking or writing books even. Personally, I prefer Notion for note-taking and vimwiki for writing books and storing informations and notes for my books. Vimwiki has a feature where I can turn all my wiki files into HTML files and view them on the browser. I recommend using vimwiki, very useful in my case.
