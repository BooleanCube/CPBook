==Syntax==
Vimwiki has a lot of cool syntax tools used for note-taking such as links, lists, tables, calendars and even schedules. Some I am yet to explore. But the second article shows a very broad and detailed overview of the basic Vimwiki Syntax.

===Basic Syntax===
*BOLD*
_ITALICS_
[[https://github.com/BooleanCube/|links (github)]]
| table1 | table2 |                  | table 3 |      |
|        |        | table 6          | table 9 |      |
|        |        |                  | tabl4   |      |
|        |        |                  |         | bruh |
|        |        | darn cool innit? |         |      |
*Keywords*: TODO, DONE, STARTED, FIXME, FIXED, XXX
=====Anchors=====
Accessing other wiki files in the text bascailly easier navigation through the wiki files in the book
Could also do External files and other links too. With anchors you can even access stuff like headers. You can even jump to headers in other files.
[.[file#anchorheader]]
you can even do mail links with "m.ailto:mail"


You can even do comments:
(Can't view on HTML)
%%hello this is a comment

===Code Blocks===
Three Bracket Characters, the language name (optional), code, the Three Bracket Characters
Example:
{{{java
import java.io.*:
import java.util.*;

public class cube {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		BufferedReader bf = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
		String input = bf.readLine();
		System.out.println(input.equalsIgnoreCase("cube") ? "cool" : "ok buddy");
	}
}
}}}



Thats the basic syntax guide!
